### Huffman coding problems
Few small programing and theoretical problems are listed here instead of programing files

- **Q1**  
  Suppose the letters a, b, c, d, e  have probabilities
  1/2, 1/4, ..., 1/32
  - Huffman codes for letters
  - Avg probability
  
  - Ans
    - Avg probability - weighted external path length
