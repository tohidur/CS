### Greedy Algo
There are optimization problem like
- Minimise cost
- Maximise profit
- Maximise reliability
- Minimise risk

There are various ways to solve such problem.
One way is to use exhaustive search (exponential time). But we want to see if there are some better way.
We found out that there are two programing paradigm to solve these optimisation problems

- **Greedy**  
  Using Greedy we may not be able to solve all the optimisation problem. The problems must have some
  characteristics.

- **Dynamic Programming**  
  Using dynamic we can solve every problem but some solutions might go to exponential time, which is similar to
  exhaustive search (O(2^n) solutions). 
  Our goal here is to avoid these and focus on finding out polynomial solutions (O(n^k)).
