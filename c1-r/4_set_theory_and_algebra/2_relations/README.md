## Relations

- **Cartesian product (or Cross Product)**  
A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {a, b}

A x B = // cross product, here elements of A should occur before elements of B.
    {(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)}

- Cardinality  
  |A| = m and |B| = n  then |AxB| = m x n

```
Relation: A relation is a subset of cartesian product


R = {(1, a}, (1, b)}
OR
1Ra =means=> (1, a) ∈ R
```

- Number of relations:  
  `2 ^ (m x n)`
 
Examples 
- Ex1:  
  Let R = { (x, y) ∈ Z x Z : x < y }  // Z - set of all integers.  
  All the relations R from A to B

### Reflexive Relation
A relation 'R' on a set 'A' is said to be reflexive if
(xRx) ∀ x∈A
